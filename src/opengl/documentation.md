# OpenGL documentation
For people working with the OpenGL abstraction layer. These are the only methods that you should ever need all collected in one document.

# Constructor
`var gl = new OpenGL(WebGLRenderingContext)`

# General
- `public releaseBuffers(): void`    
Releases all the buffers currently held in memory, should always be called when recomputing the scene.
- `public useShader(shader: Shader): void`    
Sets the shader to use for rendering the scene.
- `public resize(width: number, height: number): void`    
Resizes the OpenGL viewport to the optimal size for the given dimensions. Should be called on canvas resize events.
- `public render(): void`    
Renders the OpenGL scene.
- `public initShaders(): Shader`    
Intialises and returns the only shader we have at the moment.
- `public transformPoint(x: number, y: number, width: number, height: number): number[]`

The `x` and `y` parameters denote the point and the `width` and `height` denote the width and height of the canvas respectively. The returned array contains at index 0 the transformed `x` coordinate and at index 1 the transformed `y` coordinate.

# Rendering

### Color
All the rendering methods will ask for a color to use. The color should be provided as an array containing the red, green, blue and alpha values as floats. These floats should all be in range 0 to 1.    

Examples:    
- `var red = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0];`
- `var purple = [1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0];`
- `var black = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0];`

### Precision
All the ellipsoid methods will ask for an optional precision argument. This has to be a positive integer that is also a divisor of 360. This means that the only valid values are: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180 and 360`. The precision roughly corresponds to the length of the small lines that make up the outer perimiter of the circle, thus this means that smaller precision values imply shorter lines and thus a smoother ellipsoid. Shorter lines also implies more lines though so performance goes down when the precision value is lowered.

## Quads

Draws a filled quad with the lower left corner at the given x and y coordinate. A width and height relative to that point and the given color.

## Slices
**Note:** The precision argument for slices is a bit more relaxed and does not have to be a divisor of 360. In fact the best results are achieved when it is a divisor of the difference between the `start` and `end` argument. For a small enough precision value this difference is however unnoticeable.

The `fillColor` specifies the color to use to fill the slice and the `lineColor` specifies the color to use to draw the outline. If the `lineColor` is `null` but `line` is set to true then the `fillColor` is used to draw the outline. The optional precision argument specifies how good the slice approximation has to be.

The `fillColor` specifies the color to use to fill the slice and the `lineColor` specifies the color to use to draw the outline. If the `lineColor` is `null` but `line` is set to true then the `fillColor` is used to draw the outline. The optional precision argument specifies how good the slice approximation has to be.
